# text-gerneration-using-rnn 

Overview This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to generate text using a character-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). It uses a dataset of Shakespeare's writings and aims to predict the next character in a given sequence.

Learning Objectives Understand the basics of text generation with RNNs. Create training examples and targets for text generation. Build an RNN model for sequence generation using Keras Subclassing. Evaluate the text generated by the model. Prerequisites Python 3.x TensorFlow NumPy How to Use Download Dataset: The notebook will automatically download Shakespeare's writings from a predefined URL.
